# Mars-Sensor-
Implemented a specialized linked list and to gain familiarity with using a linked list in solving problems.


Wrote a program that reads in data (imagine it is coming from sensors) and stores that data in a special kind of linked list. After reading and storing all of the data in the program, it will generate a report from the data.
